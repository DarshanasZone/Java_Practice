/*
Day 19: Java Inheritance I

Problem Statement:
Using inheritance, one class can acquire the properties of another class.

You are given an Animal class with a walk() method.
Create a Bird class that extends Animal and add the following methods:
1. fly() – prints "I am flying"
2. sing() – prints "I am singing"

In the main method, create a Bird object and call:
- walk()
- fly()
- sing()

Expected Output:
I am walking
I am flying
I am singing
